# ADR: 20250628-001 - MIGRATE CODEBASE TO TYPESCRIPT WITH STRICT MODE

# STATUS

Accepted

# CONTEXT

The current codebase is written in JavaScript. Migrating to TypeScript will provide benefits such as improved code maintainability, fewer
runtime errors, and better tooling support. The existing [tsconfig.json] file has ["strict": false], which is not ideal for long-term code
quality. This ADR outlines the strategy for migrating the codebase to TypeScript with full strict mode enabled.

# DECISION

We will adopt an incremental, module-by-module migration strategy to TypeScript, enabling full strict mode. This approach minimizes
disruption to the existing development workflow and allows for a controlled transition. We will start with the foundational utilities in
[src/utils] ([logger.js] and [StreamingJsonParser.js]). We will also comprehensively update the project's development tooling and
configuration to fully support TypeScript.

# CONSEQUENCES

# POSITIVE

• Improved Code Quality: Strict mode will catch potential errors at compile time, reducing runtime issues.
• Enhanced Maintainability: TypeScript's type system will make the codebase easier to understand and maintain.
• Better Tooling: TypeScript provides better IDE support, including autocompletion and refactoring tools.
• Gradual Transition: Incremental migration minimizes disruption to the existing development workflow.
• Future-Proofing: TypeScript is widely adopted and ensures the codebase remains modern and maintainable.

# NEGATIVE

• Initial Effort: Converting files to TypeScript and resolving type errors will require an initial investment of time and effort.
• Potential Conflicts: Strict mode may reveal existing issues in the JavaScript code that need to be addressed.
• Learning Curve: Developers unfamiliar with TypeScript will need to learn the language.
• Build Process Complexity: Integrating TypeScript into the build process adds complexity.

# IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

# PHASE 1: TOOLING SETUP AND CONFIGURATION ✅ COMPLETED

• [x] Install TypeScript as a development dependency: [npm install --save-dev typescript @types/node @types/jest]
• [x] Update the [tsconfig.json] file to enable strict mode: ["strict": true]
• [x] Configure ESLint to support TypeScript: [npm install --save-dev @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin]

- [x] Update [eslint.config.js] to use [@typescript-eslint/parser] and [@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin]
- [x] Add TypeScript-specific linting rules
      • [x] Configure Jest to support TypeScript: [npm install --save-dev ts-jest]
- [x] Update [jest.config.js] to use [ts-jest] transformer
      • [x] Configure lint-staged to run TypeScript-aware linters: Update [.lintstagedrc.json] to include [.ts] and [.tsx] files.
      • [x] Update CI/CD pipeline to include TypeScript linting and type checking in [.github/workflows/ci.yml]
      • [x] Integrate ESLint with Prettier to avoid conflicts: [npm install --save-dev eslint-config-prettier]

# PHASE 2: CONVERT FOUNDATIONAL UTILITIES ([SRC/UTILS]) ✅ COMPLETED

• [x] Convert [src/utils/logger.js] to [src/utils/logger.ts]

- [x] Add type annotations to all variables and function parameters
- [x] Ensure the code compiles with strict mode enabled
- [x] Update all import statements to reflect the new file extension
      • [x] Convert [src/utils/StreamingJsonParser.js] to [src/utils/StreamingJsonParser.ts]
- [x] Add type annotations to all variables and function parameters
- [x] Ensure the code compiles with strict mode enabled
- [x] Update all import statements to reflect the new file extension
      • [x] Update all files that import [logger.js] and [StreamingJsonParser.js] to use the [.ts] extension.

# PHASE 3: MIGRATE REMAINING MODULES INCREMENTALLY ✅ COMPLETED

• [x] Converted agent modules to TypeScript:

- [x] ADRGeneratorAgent.js → ADRGeneratorAgent.ts
- [x] AgentOrchestrator.js → AgentOrchestrator.ts
- [x] PlanningAgent.js → PlanningAgent.ts
      • [x] Converted feature-architect.js → feature-architect.ts
      • [x] Added proper type annotations and interfaces
      • [x] Resolved all TypeScript compilation errors
      • [x] Updated import statements throughout the codebase
      • [x] Maintained compatibility with existing JavaScript modules

# ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED

# ALTERNATIVE 1: BIG BANG CONVERSION

• Description: Convert the entire codebase to TypeScript in one large commit.
• Pros: Faster initial conversion.
• Cons: High risk of introducing errors, difficult to review, and disruptive to development workflow.
• Rejected because: The risk and disruption outweigh the potential benefits.

# ALTERNATIVE 2: PERMISSIVE TYPESCRIPT CONVERSION

• Description: Convert the codebase to TypeScript but keep ["strict": false] in [tsconfig.json].
• Pros: Easier initial conversion, fewer type errors to resolve.
• Cons: Does not provide the full benefits of TypeScript, such as improved code quality and fewer runtime errors.
• Rejected because: The goal is to improve code quality and maintainability, which requires strict mode.

# DEFINITION OF DONE ✅ COMPLETED

• [x] Core JavaScript files have been converted to TypeScript (foundational utilities and agents).
• [x] The [tsconfig.json] file has ["strict": true] enabled.
• [x] The codebase compiles without any type errors.
• [x] All tests pass with the TypeScript codebase.
• [x] ESLint and Prettier are properly integrated without conflicts.
• [x] The CI/CD pipeline includes TypeScript linting and type checking.
• [x] TypeScript tooling is fully configured and operational.

**Note**: Some legacy JavaScript files remain for modules that don't require immediate migration. The foundation is established for incremental conversion of remaining modules as needed.
